 * Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
 *
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
 * characters.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not
 * a substring.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = ""
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
